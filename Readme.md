## Learning & Experience

Working on this project was a fantastic learning experience. I discovered how to fetch dynamic content from external APIs using just a few lines of JavaScript and CSS. I implemented advanced features such as:
- Real-time search with loading indicators.
- Interactive UI elements like modal dialogs.
- Persistent wishlist management using localStorage.
- A modern, responsive design enhanced with gradient buttons and smooth transitions.

I even used AI to help generate some CSS, then refined it with human-friendly comments and explanations to ensure clarity and maintainability. This project not only boosted my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for well-crafted interactive applications.
